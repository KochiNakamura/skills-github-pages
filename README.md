# visma e-conomic hiring task

### User stories:

1. As a freelancer I want to be able to register how I spend time on my _projects_, so that I can provide my _customers_ with an overview of my work.
2. As a freelancer I want to be able to get an _overview of my time registrations per project_, so that I can create correct invoices for my customers.
3. As a freelancer I want to be able to _sort my projects by their deadline_, so that I can prioritise my work.

Individual time registrations should be 30 minutes or longer, and once a project is complete it can no longer receive new registrations. You do not need to create an actual invoice.

## Considerations

- Works, obviously
- Contains readable, bug free code
- Is appropriately covered by tests, in the frontend and backend (where required)
- Follows sensible structured design patterns and thought proceses
- Validates user input and contains test coverage for these use cases, at least in the backend
- The front-end is typed using typescript
- Consider how your application might scale as it grows in use, and in number of developers working on it
- Summarise any significant architectural decisions you take, to discuss in the presentation

## Development

1. Install dependencies - `npm install`
2. Run project - `npm start`
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app
